-- Frontend vue---

For the vue frontend, we need to install the modules to be used in vue.

cd ./frontend

command : npm install

After install modules, you will get modules node_modules,
And then run this command : npm run serve.

and then you will get port like http://localhost:8080 (This is frontend port)

--- Backend golang --

you run the main.exe file in project.

and then backend port will be 8000


this is not complex...
